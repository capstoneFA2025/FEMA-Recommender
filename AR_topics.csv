The State of Illinois is requesting an extension of the current Incident Management Team (IMT) deployment through RRF# 48-7673, which provides federal support to the States mass vaccination planning and operational programs. The state of Illinois is seeking this command element to assist the State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC) in augmenting and providing technical assistance to existing personnel as the roles and responsibilities of the Vaccination LOE expand with the movement towards privatization at state/local fixed sites, expansion of mobile equity capabilities to high-SVI locations statewide, introduction of state/faith-based mobile capabilities, and continued operations of the United Center Mobile Equity Vaccination teams. IL focus on expanded planning support provided by the IMT includes continual planning for vaccinations using equity-based delivery and administration to undeserved and isolated rural communities. Illinois is requesting that the extension be for an additional 30-days beginning with the end date of the current IMT deployment. This request has been coordinated with the current IMT IC and FEMA LNO. Throughout the deployment of IMT in support of Illinois an evaluation will be completed to determine the need for an additional extension or demobilization of this resource. To ensure ongoing capabilities that the State cannot fill these critical roles and responsibilities through existing capability or contractual staffing. The State of Illinois request for an extension of support is for: IC, PIO, (2) Liaison, (2) OPS, (1) Operational Planner, (1) PSC), (1) SITL, (1) RESL, (1) LSC, (1) LOG Specialist, and (1) FINANCE Section Chief. OPERATIONAL SCHEDULE To continue operations and ensure continuity of operations throughout a transition we request the current IMT extend for a maximum of 5-days for transition of C2 and cross-orientation. This 5-day transition will allow the incoming IC with assigning and integrating positions pertaining to skillsets on the team.

The Texas Panhandle area (TSA A and B) is seeing an increase of decedents needing to be processed. This increase combined with the fact that funeral home staff in this area are in short supply and have been impacted by COVID-19 themselves, is causing a back-log at funeral homes and hospitals. The total number of COVID deaths for the Texas Panhandle area (TSA A and B) is currently 870. Over the past month there have been 53 deaths in TSA-A, and 203 deaths in TSA-B, accounting for almost 30% of the total deaths for this area in just the past month alone.

working (the owners). Other embalmers on staff are out with COVID or on maternity leave. They have been unable to hire any new staff and submitted a STAR request for 4 embalmers. The owners at Shafer have stated they are 
exhausted and desperately need help. Due to the fact that the owners are having to perform embalming services, administrative duties are being impacted which slows down other aspects of funeral services. 

DSHS has tried to source embalming staff from other areas in Texas but have been unsuccessful due to the high demand and low availability of these staff. DSHS asked Texas Funeral Directors Association, the Texas Funeral Service Commission and the Harris County Institute of Forensic Sciences to support this STAR and they were unable to provide embalmers.
