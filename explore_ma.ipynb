       "Deploy the Power Planning and Response Team (PRT), 249th Engineer Battalion, DTOS and ACI Contractor and provide emergency power generation to the affected area as directed by FEMA. All plans of action must be coordinated with the State. Implement Advanced Contracting Initiative (ACI) or other contracting process to provide generators and related resources. This action may include shipping and transporting generators and Bill of Materials (BOM) (e.g,. wires, connectors, and load banks), in coordination with FEMA Logistics, as appropriate, to/from logistics centers (LC), mobilization center(s), or other delivery sites. Perform site assessments for locations provided by the FEMA Project Officer to determine the need for temporary electrical services to critical facilities (the assessment(s) will include size(s), configuration, and quantity). Haul generators from the mobilization center or other storage site, and install, operate, and maintain generators using contractor support and/or Federal assets. To accomplish these actions, generators and associated BOM supplied by FEMA, DoD, and/or leased from a contractor may be used. Provide for the recovery and rehabilitation of FEMA-owned generators, either in the field or at the LC/remote storage site in coordination with FEMA Logistics. Assets will be returned to the LC/RSS fully mission capable in coordination with FEMA Logistics.

If approved, documentation is necessary to ensure reimbursement.\\r\\n4. Activation of agency command center(s), if required, must be coordinated with FEMA as a separate MA.\\r\\n5. The mission-assigned agency is responsible for ensuring that all activity is properly authorized, goods are received, services are provided, and that costs are reasonable and supported by documentation maintained by the respective agency.\\r\\n6. MAs shall be considered for fiscal closure or reduction of obligations 180 days after the projected end date in accordance with the FEMA Policy 104.010.3. For MAs still operationally open, requests for additional obligations may be withheld if no invoicing, ULO Validation, or additional justification has been provided.\\r\\n7. Prior to departing disaster operations, provide FEMA with details on status of any ongoing actions, property disposition (if applicable), and Financial/Program points of contact.\\r\\n8. Sharing of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) between the agencies is not authorized by this MA. The agencies must complete an Information Sharing Access Agreement (ISAA), an Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA) and/or a Privacy Threshold Analysis (PTA), if required by either Agency, before data is transferred between the agencies.\\r\\n9. A final inspection report will be completed upon termination of all direct Federal assistance work. Final inspection reports shall be signed by a representative of the performing Federal agency and the STT pursuant to 44 CFR.     1\n",
